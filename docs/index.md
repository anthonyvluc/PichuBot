# PROJECT GOALS

![PichuBot Gif](InsertGifHere)

The [Asian American Association](https://www3.nd.edu/~aaa/) community at the University of Notre Dame looks to create a welcoming environment for all of its members, those who are 0 - 100% Asian. AAA is an umbrella club of many smaller cultural student associations with a more narrowed focus. Through [Discord](https://discordapp.com/), the club hopes to provide a common platform to connect its undergraduate members, retain communication with alumni, and spread information about AAA and ND events on campus.

In order to maintain the Discord, [PichuBot](https://github.com/anthonyvluc/PichuBot) is a Discord Bot that helps manage the AAA Discord Server. PichuBot supports the community with various commands and automation to better engage the community and support the execution of the AAA Board. Explore the server to dive into the AAA Family today!
